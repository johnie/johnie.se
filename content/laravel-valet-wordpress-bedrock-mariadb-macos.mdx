Laravel Valet provides a fast and lightweight local development environment for WordPress on macOS. This tutorial will guide you through setting up Valet with Bedrock, a modern WordPress boilerplate, and MariaDB.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- MacOS
- Homebrew
- Composer

### Step 1: Install PHP and MariaDB

First, install PHP and MariaDB using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install php
brew install mariadb
```

Start MariaDB and enable it to start on boot:

```bash
brew services start mariadb
```

### Step 2: Install Composer and Valet

Install Composer globally if you haven't already:

```bash
brew install composer
```

Now install Laravel Valet:

```bash
composer global require laravel/valet
valet install
```

### Step 3: Install WP-CLI and Valet Plugin

Install WP-CLI and the Valet plugin:

```bash
brew install wp-cli
wp package install aaemnnosttv/wp-cli-valet-command:^1.0
```

### Step 4: Create a New Bedrock Project

Navigate to your preferred directory and create a new Bedrock project:

```bash
composer create-project roots/bedrock your-project-name
cd your-project-name
```

### Step 5: Configure Valet

Park Valet in your project directory:

```bash
valet park
```

Your site should now be accessible at `http://your-project-name.test`.

### Step 6: Set Up the Database

Create a new database for your project:

```bash
mysql -uroot -e "CREATE DATABASE your_database_name"
```

### Step 7: Configure Bedrock

Edit the `.env` file in your project root and update the database settings:

```
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
```

### Step 8: Install WordPress

Use WP-CLI to install WordPress:

```bash
wp core install --url=http://your-project-name.test --title="Your Site Title" --admin_user=admin --admin_password=your_password --admin_email=your@email.com
```

### Step 9: Secure Your Site (Optional)

To use HTTPS locally, run:

```bash
valet secure your-project-name
```

Your site will now be accessible at `https://your-project-name.test`.

## Conclusion

You now have a local WordPress development environment using Laravel Valet, Bedrock, and MariaDB. This setup provides a fast, lightweight solution for WordPress development on macOS.

Remember to run `valet park` in any new directories where you want to serve sites, and use `valet link` for individual projects outside of parked directories.
