**It's time to ace the email game with tactics that set you apart.**

Email communication and "Slacketiquette" are topics that I've been itching to delve into for quite some time now. Now, motivated and inspired, I am ready to share my insights on the subject. If you're interested in gaining a perspective that's a tad unorthodox, read on.

## 1. Harness the Power of a Well-Crafted Subject Line

The subject line is your secret weapon for both internal and external emails. By refining the subject line, you can **SAVE A CLICK** and set the stage for your reader.

### Use [LABELS] to Transform Internal Emails into Actionable Tasks

Employ `[LABELS]` that signify the email's **"subject"** or **"request."** Supplement the label with related details.

When I use labels like `[ACTION REQUIRED]` or `[READ]`, it primes the recipient with the right context, reducing the chance of any unexpected surprises when they uncover the request within the email.

- **Example:** `[ACTION REQUIRED] OKRs Need Edits by Tomorrow`
- **Example:** `[SALES STATS] 11.26 Closed ESPN @ $XX`
- **Example:** `[PRODUCT AGENDA] 11.10 Goal: Launch media posts`

For recurring emails, like weekly sales updates, or a specific deal's communication, consistent labeling can improve searchability. To locate something, a simple search for `[SALES]` or `[ASSET DELIVERY]` does the trick.

### Implement the [ACK] Label for Group Emails

A transformative label that's worth learning is: `[ACK]`. Use `[ACK]` when you want everyone cc’d to "acknowledge" receipt of the email.

However, the effectiveness of `[ACK]` relies on its adoption throughout the organization. This understanding means that if an email's subject doesn't ask for acknowledgement, there's no need to reply to all, reducing unnecessary "thanks," "got it," "ok" messages sent to all recipients.

For critical messages, an email with `[ACK]` in the subject and a quick "ack" from everyone on the thread can streamline communication, raising the email's importance above all else.

### Use Your [COMPANY NAME] for Familiar Contacts

When emailing an investor, customer, or contact with whom I have a good rapport, I use my company's name as the label.

- **Example:** `[WIRED IN] Request for intro to XX Company`

This way, they can effortlessly find all communication from your company by simply searching "[WIRED IN]."

## 2. Propose Meeting Times: A Simple Courtesy

When you need to set up ANY meeting, please propose times or mention that you're willing to propose them.

Respect Their Time: Propose 3-5 Options When trying to meet someone without time constraints, I suggest 3-5 available time slots spread across different days. This approach respects their time and avoids the tiresome "scheduling" back-and-forth.

This applies to sales meetings, get-togethers, investor calls, or **ANYTHING** that necessitates scheduling.

When proposing times, I clearly state:

- **Example:** `Tuesday, Dec 3 @ 13:00 - 15:00`

Ease Their Decision: Offer to Propose Times Offering to propose times provides the recipient an easy way to respond positively, saying **"Yes, I'm available, let me know when you can meet."**

## 3. Aim for Brevity: Optimize for Mobile Reading

Strive to be concise. That doesn't mean sending only one-liners but breaking up your thoughts for better readability. Highlight the key takeaway. Ask yourself: _"What's the one message I want them to remember while they skim this on their way to a meeting?"_

Remember, most people access their emails on their phones. Long emails can seem overwhelming on small screens. Bullet points and bolded key ideas can significantly improve the reading experience.

## 4. The Magic of Deadlines: Set Expectations & Facilitate Follow-ups

Including a date in your email provides a deadline for action or a cue for follow-ups.

Specify if you need a response within a certain period or if a task needs completion before a certain date. This helps recipients prioritize their tasks.

If there's no response or action within your stipulated time frame, it provides a valid reason for follow-ups, like a gentle reminder: **"Hey, I warned you I'd be back…"**

## 5. Respect the CC (and the BCC)

Never casually drop someone cc'd on an email thread. It's not only unprofessional but also inconvenient as it often necessitates re-including the right people. Respect the communication protocol, and it will streamline your correspondence.

## Example of an email with all the above tips

> **Subject:** `[ACTION REQUIRED] Finalize Q4 Targets by Friday`
>
> Dear Emily,
>
> I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of Q3, it's time to finalize our Q4 targets. I've included the proposed objectives and key results (OKRs) in the attached document.
>
> **Could you please review and provide your feedback by this Friday, August 11th?** This will give us ample time to address any concerns and make necessary adjustments before we kickstart Q4. Here's the document: `Q4 Targets Draft.xlsx`
>
> Here are a few key points to consider:
>
> - The **sales targets** are based on Q3 performance and the expected growth in Q4.
> - The **marketing objectives** align with our new product launch.
> - Our **customer success goals** aim to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.
>
> I understand that you're likely juggling multiple priorities, and I appreciate your time and effort in reviewing this. If your schedule is tight, just drop me a line, and I'll be happy to propose a few time slots for a meeting to walk through the OKRs together.
>
> Best regards,
>
> [Your Name]

Mastering the art of email communication can drastically enhance your productivity, increase your influence, and save everyone's time. It's not about firing off quick responses, but crafting messages that respect your recipient's time and energy while achieving your objectives.
