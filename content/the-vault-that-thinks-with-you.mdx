Your notes are lonely.

That brilliant insight from last Tuesday? Buried in a file you'll never open again. The connection between your hiring process and that article about async communication? Lost forever because the two notes never met.

Most note-taking is archaeology. You dig through folders hoping to find something useful. But what if your vault could think *with* you, surfacing connections, maintaining context, and evolving alongside your understanding?

This is a practical guide to making that happen using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) and [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code), combining the best local-first knowledge base with an AI that can read, understand, and help you navigate your thinking.

## The Shift: Writer to Curator

Traditional note-taking puts you in the writer's seat. You capture, you organize, you maintain. It's exhausting, which is why most systems collapse under their own weight.

AI-powered note-taking inverts this. You become the curator, deciding what matters, what connects, what stays. The AI handles the grunt work: finding related notes, suggesting links, maintaining consistency.

Your job shifts from "write everything down" to "judge what's valuable."

This isn't laziness. It's leverage. The same way a senior engineer reviews code instead of writing every line, you review and refine what the AI produces.

## Teaching Your AI: The CLAUDE.md Deep Dive

[Claude](https://claude.ai/code) doesn't know your system. You have to teach it.

The `CLAUDE.md` file is your teaching document, placed at your vault's root, it explains how your system works. Here's a practical structure:

```markdown
# Vault Philosophy

This vault tracks projects, thinking, and reference material.
Core principle: capture quickly, structure deliberately.

## Structure (PARA-inspired)

- `01_Inbox/` - Capture zone. Everything lands here first.
- `02_Projects/` - Active work with clear outcomes
- `03_Areas/` - Ongoing responsibilities (health, finances, home)
- `04_Resources/` - Reference material organized by topic
- `05_Archive/` - Completed or inactive items

## Language Rules

- Default to English for technical content
- Swedish acceptable for personal notes
- Keep titles in English for consistent linking

## Frontmatter Standards

Every note needs:
```yaml
---
created: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [relevant, tags]
status: active | completed | archived
---
```

## Linking Expectations

- Link inline, not at the bottom. Write "because [[async beats sync]]"
  not "Related: async-beats-sync"
- Every note should have at least one incoming link
- Hub pages link to all related notes in a topic

## Naming Conventions

Notes are claims, not topics:
- ❌ "Hiring thoughts"
- ✅ "Good hires communicate proactively"

The title should complete the sentence "I believe that..."
```

### What Heinrich Missed

His article covers the philosophy beautifully but skips the mechanics. Here's what you actually need:

**Override defaults explicitly.** Claude has opinions. If you want something specific, say it:

```markdown
## Overrides

- Never create folders without asking
- Always preserve existing frontmatter when editing
- Suggest links but don't add them automatically
```

**Teach your terminology.** If "PA" means "personal assistant" in your vault, say so:

```markdown
## Vocabulary

- PA = Personal Assistant (not Pennsylvania, not Public Address)
- WIP = Work in Progress (notes still being developed)
```

## The Daily Dance: Workflows

### Morning Capture

Dump everything into inbox. Zero friction:

```
vault/01_Inbox/
├── quick-thought-about-api.md
├── meeting-notes-2026-01-20.md
└── article-to-read-later.md
```

No structure, no formatting, just capture.

### Inbox Processing (10 minutes)

Ask Claude to process your inbox:

> "Review 01_Inbox/. For each note: suggest a destination folder, recommend links to existing notes, and flag if it should be split into multiple notes."

Review the suggestions. Move what makes sense. Delete what doesn't matter.

### The Automation Layer

For repetitive patterns, create slash commands. Example for processing job applications:

```markdown
# /process-application

1. Read the new application in 01_Inbox/
2. Extract: name, key skills, communication style, red flags
3. Create note in 02_Projects/Hiring/Applications/
4. Link to [[Hiring Project Hub]]
5. Add to comparison table if multiple candidates exist
```

This turns a 15-minute task into a 2-minute review.

### Weekly Review

- Inbox zero: everything processed or deleted
- Move completed projects to Archive
- Check for orphan notes (no incoming links)
- Update hub pages with new connections

### Monthly Sweep

- Archive stale projects (no updates in 30+ days)
- Review CLAUDE.md, does it still reflect how you work?
- Regenerate index if you use one

## Note Architecture

### Before: The Isolated Note

```markdown
# Hiring Thoughts

Need to find a PA. Should be good at communication.
Maybe look at care.com or similar.
```

This note will die alone. No links, vague title, no structure.

### After: The Connected Hub

```markdown
---
created: 2026-01-15
tags: [project, hiring, active]
status: active
---

# PA Hiring Project

Finding a personal assistant for daily support tasks.

## Key Insight

[[Good PAs communicate proactively]], this matters more than
specific skills because tasks change but communication style doesn't.

## Candidates

- [[Application - Maria S]] - Strong async communication
- [[Application - Erik L]] - Local, flexible schedule

## Process

Following [[Structured hiring reduces bias]].

## Timeline

- Week 1: Post and collect applications
- Week 2: Initial screening via [[Async interview questions]]
- Week 3: Trial tasks with top 2 candidates

**Status:** Screening phase
**Next action:** Review new applications Friday
```

The difference: this note *participates* in your vault. It links, it's linked to, it has clear structure for AI navigation.

### The Backlink Footer

Always close with navigation:

```markdown
---

**Back to:** [[Areas/Home Management]] | [[Projects Overview]]
```

This helps both you and Claude understand the note's place in the hierarchy.

### Frontmatter for Tracking

Use frontmatter for state that changes:

```yaml
---
created: 2026-01-18
status: awaiting-response
responded: true
next_action: follow-up if no reply by 2026-01-22
---
```

Claude can query this: "Show me all notes where `responded: true` but `status: awaiting-response` for more than 3 days."

## Common Mistakes

### Over-structuring too early

You don't need 15 folders on day one. Start with:

```
vault/
├── 01_Inbox/
├── 02_Active/
├── 03_Archive/
└── CLAUDE.md
```

Add structure when you feel friction, not before.

### Using AI as search instead of thinking partner

Bad: "Find my note about hiring"
Good: "I'm preparing for a candidate interview. What patterns have I noticed in successful vs unsuccessful hires based on my notes?"

Search finds files. Thinking partners synthesize.

### Not reviewing Claude's work

AI makes mistakes. It will:
- Create duplicate notes
- Misunderstand your conventions
- Add links that don't make sense

Always review. Your judgment is the quality filter.

### Orphan notes

A note without incoming links is invisible to the network. Every note should answer: "What other note would link here?"

If nothing would link to it, either:
1. It belongs in a different vault
2. It needs to be split into linkable claims
3. It's not worth keeping

## Maintenance as Meditation

This isn't busywork. Regular maintenance is how you stay connected to your thinking.

### Weekly (15 minutes)

- [ ] Inbox at zero
- [ ] Check orphan notes ([Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) graph view helps)
- [ ] Update one hub with recent connections

### Monthly (30 minutes)

- [ ] Archive completed projects
- [ ] Review and update CLAUDE.md
- [ ] Look for notes that should be merged

### Quarterly (1 hour)

- [ ] Philosophy review: Is the vault serving its purpose?
- [ ] Structure audit: Do folders still make sense?
- [ ] Link quality: Are connections meaningful or cluttered?

## The Vault Remembers

Here's the magic: Claude has no memory between sessions. But your vault does.

When you teach Claude something, a convention, a connection, an insight, encode it in the vault. Write a note. Update CLAUDE.md. Add a link.

Next session, Claude reads those notes and picks up where you left off. The vault becomes shared memory between you and every future AI session.

Your notes stop being static files. They become a living system that thinks with you, remembers for you, and grows alongside your understanding.

The question isn't whether to build this system. It's what you'll do with all that recovered mental space.
