Leading a team is both an art and a science. Over the past 15 years, my experience has shown that 90% of team issues stem from skipping three fundamental practices: setting clear expectations, conducting effective one-on-one meetings, and providing consistent feedback. Let’s delve into these areas and explore why they are crucial for team success.

## Clear Expectations

To achieve success, everyone needs to understand the game they are playing. This means clearly communicating:

- **How you’re keeping score (the What):** Employees need to know what success looks like. Defining key performance indicators (KPIs) and objectives helps everyone align their efforts towards common goals.
- **What rules they’re expected to follow (the How):** Establishing guidelines and standards for how tasks should be performed ensures consistency and fairness.

When expectations are not communicated, they become secret goals that no one can meet, leading to frustration and underperformance.

## One-on-One Meetings

Regular one-on-one meetings are critical for maintaining engagement and development. Highly engaged employees need three things:

1. **Impact:** Understanding whether their work matters. Asking, "Does my work matter?" helps employees connect their tasks to the bigger picture.
2. **Development:** Opportunities for growth. Asking, "How can I get better?" provides a pathway for continuous improvement.
3. **Support:** Assistance when they hit roadblocks. Asking, "Can you get me unstuck?" ensures that employees feel supported and valued.

With a well-structured 30-minute weekly meeting, you can address all three of these needs, keeping your team motivated and productive.

## Consistent Feedback

Feedback is a powerful tool for improvement. However, we all have distorted self-images, and feedback helps in two main ways:

- **For the self-critic:** It helps them recognize their successes. Positive reinforcement can boost confidence and motivation.
- **For the over-confident:** It helps them identify their blind spots. Constructive feedback is essential for personal and professional growth.

Minor corrections can lead to significant improvements over time. Conversely, withholding feedback can create mistrust, which spreads like cancer and undermines team cohesion.

## The Harsh Truth

Ultimately, the choice is clear. You pay the same price whether you implement these practices or not:

- **Skip them,** and you will spend time and resources cleaning up messes and dealing with misunderstandings.
- **Implement them,** and you invest upfront in high performance, leading to a more efficient, engaged, and successful team.

By consistently applying these three practices—setting clear expectations, holding meaningful one-on-one meetings, and providing consistent feedback—you can avoid many common pitfalls and drive your team to greater heights of performance and satisfaction. The investment you make in these areas will pay off manifold in the long run.
