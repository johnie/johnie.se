As a **Head of Engineering**, I focus on building high-performing teams and advocating for **AI-assisted development** to boost engineering productivity. I'm also passionate about **inclusive engineering cultures**. As someone with a physical disability and founder of [**Crip in Tech**](https://crip.io), I know firsthand how diverse perspectives drive innovation.

## Why Inclusivity Matters to Me

My journey in tech began as a self-taught developer, starting from a high school internship at a web agency in Stockholm. Along the way, my **physical disability** wasn't an obstacle. It became a catalyst for understanding how diverse perspectives drive innovation. Over 15+ years, I've grown from intern to engineering leader, but more importantly, I've learned that **the most powerful teams are the ones where everyone thrives**.

That belief led me to found [**Crip in Tech**](https://crip.io), an initiative dedicated to making the tech industry more inclusive for disabled people. Through Crip in Tech, we're building a community, sharing stories, and creating pathways for more crips to thrive in technology. The mission is simple: **enrich the tech community with more disabled voices, perspectives, and talent**.

If you're interested in supporting or getting involved with Crip in Tech, don't hesitate to reach out.

## The Path Here

I've journeyed from a self-taught web developer to **Head of Engineering**, leading teams at companies across the industry. My approach centers on one core belief: **great products come from great people**. That means investing in personal and professional development, creating environments where people can do their best work, and constantly learning from mistakes.

I'm a strong believer in **continuous improvement**, whether that's refining processes, optimizing code, or helping team members grow. The goal isn't perfection; it's progress. And the best progress happens when everyone on the team feels empowered to contribute their unique perspective.
