title: 'Building People, Building Products.'
summary: 'Helping people and teams grow while building meaningful technology.'

Hey, I'm Johnie Hjelm! I'm 33 years old, currently living in Sigtuna, Stockholm with my beloved [fiancée](https://izabela.se) and have more than 15 years of experience in the tech industry. I've journeyed from a high school intern to **Head of Engineering**, overcoming the unique hurdles posed by my **physical disability** along the way. My initial experience at a web agency sparked a **self-taught path in web development**, fueling my conviction that **technology has the power to better lives**. In my current role, I put a strong emphasis on both **personal and professional development** within my team.

## Leadership Mantra

My leadership mantra is straightforward: **stay humble, stay hungry**. This philosophy is at the core of every project I oversee and every team I lead. The goal is not just to build **exceptional products**, but also to cultivate an environment that **nurtures growth and development** in individuals. At the end of the day, I want to build both great products and great people.

## Inclusivity in Tech

In my personal endeavors, I'm committed to making the tech industry more **inclusive** through my initiative, [Crip in Tech](https://crip.io). By focusing on inclusivity, I aim to help others overcome their own challenges, enriching the tech community **with more crips**.

## What I Value

I love when things fit together well and deliver value.

It can be a group of people working well together, a piece of code shipped without bugs, a well-crafted design, a great piece of software architecture, an elegant solution to a user's problem… if it works well and serves a purpose, then I'll be proud to be associated with it!

Because of this I like optimising things — no matter the thing. Meetings need to be focused and interesting, code without bugs, processes simple and clear. I'm a big believer in **continuous improvement** and **learning from mistakes**.

In a work environment, I value…

- Working with a group of **genuinely nice & interesting people**
- The **positive real life impact** our work can have
- **Work well done**, meaning code that doesn't crash, clear specifications, effective design…
- People who **keep learning** and are **curious** about all parts of the organisation
- Team members who **challenge ideas in a constructive and healthy way**
- Autonomous people proactively **taking ownership and accountability**
- **Honesty, humility, good faith, transparency and openness to dialog**
- An **ethical approach** to problems and solutions
- A **sane work/life balance**
- **Diversity** coming in many forms, like gender but also nationality and disability
- **Continuous improvement** for both systems and peoples
