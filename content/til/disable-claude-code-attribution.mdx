### Disable Claude Code Attribution in Git Commits and PRs

Claude Code adds "Co-authored-by" attribution to commits and PR descriptions by default. To disable this, configure empty strings in your settings:

```json
{
  "attribution": {
    "commit": "",
    "pr": ""
  }
}
```

Add this to `~/.claude/settings.json` for global configuration, or `.claude/settings.json` in your project root for per-project settings. Restart Claude Code for changes to take effect.
