### Formatting Commit Messages with `fmt` 

You can use the `fmt` command to format commit messages in Git for better readability. Here's a useful command:

```bash
fmt -n -p -w 80
```

- `-n`: Preserves indented lines, making bullet points or code snippets in the message clear.
- `-p`: Avoids formatting lines that already begin with indentation, useful for keeping lists and indented code unchanged.
- `-w 80`: Wraps text at 80 characters, which is a common convention for commit message width.
